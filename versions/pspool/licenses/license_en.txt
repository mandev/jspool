Software License Agreement
Copyright  (c)2004 Emmanuel Deviller 

This Agreement is a legal contract that specifies the terms of the license and warranty limitation between you and Emmanuel Deviller for the pSpool software and related documentation. You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before installing or using the software. Installation or use of the software indicates your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions and acceptance of disclaimer of warranty. If you do not agree to these terms, promptly delete and destroy all copies of the software and related documentation in your possession.

1) Versions of the Software 

pSpool software is available in a commercial and an evaluation version.  Both the commercial and the evaluation versions are subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The commercial version of the software requires payment by you of a license fee.  The evaluation version of the software is the only version that is provided without charge.  However, the evaluation version is not free software and is subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Emmanuel Deviller grants to you a temporary license to use the software for evaluation purposes without charge on a single computer with one keyboard/display, i.e., a computer intended to be used by one person at a time for a period of no more than 30 days.  If you continue to use the software after the 30-day evaluation period, then payment of the registration fee is required. Unregistered use of the software after this 30-day evaluation period is in violation of international copyright laws and this licensing agreement. If the registration fee is not paid at the end of this 30-day evaluation period then all traces of the software must be removed and destroyed. 

2) License to Use

Once the registration fee has been paid, Emmanuel Deviller grants to you a non-exclusive and non-tranferable license to use the software on a single computer with one keyboard/display.

The software and documentation are protected by the copyright laws and international treaty provisions. You may not copy all or any part of the software or related documentation, except that you may make a reasonable number of copies of the software solely for backup or archival purposes.

Under no circumstances are you permitted to further copy, loan, rent, or redistribute the software or portions thereof whether during the evaluation period or after the registration fee has been paid to Emmanuel Deviller.
 
Emmanuel Deviller's software is under copyright and contains proprietary information belonging to Emmanuel Deviller, its licensors and/or its partners. It is understood that no right, title, or interest to any copyrights, trademarks or trade names of Emmanuel Deviller, its licensors or its partners is granted or inferred by this license agreement.

3) No Additional Licenses

You acknowledge and agree that except for the rights granted in this Agreement, all other rights, and all title and interest in and to the pSpool software (as an independent work and as an underlying work serving as a basis for any application you may develop) and related documentation remain the sole and exclusive property of Emmanuel Deviller and its licensors, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other proprietary rights therein, and that you will not derive or assert any title or interest in or to such software or related documentation.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge that you do not receive any rights, title or interest to any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names or other intellectual property rights to the software or related documentation at any time or under any circumstances.  You may not alter, merge, adapt, modify, translate, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract or otherwise reverse engineer the pSpool software or documentation. You may not remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the software. This Agreement does not authorize you to use Emmanuel Deviller's name or any of its trademarks.

4) Term and Termination

If you have acquired an evaluation version, the license granted herein shall automatically terminate thirty (30) days after you first install such version.  Subsequent downloads, installations or use of the evaluation version by or for you will not extend, renew, or otherwise restart the term of the license. Upon the termination of a license for any reason, you must promptly destroy all copies of the software and related documentation covered by the license.

5) Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SOFTWARE AND THE ACCOMPANYING FILES ARE SOLD "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY REMEDIES, REPRESENTATIONS, PROMISES, GUARANTEES  AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES.  Because of the various hardware and software environments into which the software may be put, good data processing procedure dictates that any software be thoroughly tested with non-critical data before relying on it. The user must assume the entire risk of using the software. 

By way of example, without limitation, Emmanuel Deviller provides no warranties of any kind to any end-users accessing or otherwise using applications developed or otherwise obtained by you. Because programs such as this are inherently complex, Emmanuel Deviller does not warrant that the software is error-free or will operate without interruption. You acknowledge that due to the complexity of the software, it is possible that use of the software could lead to the unintentional loss or corruption of data.  You assume all risks of such data loss or corruption. The software is not designed or licensed for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe controls, including without limitation operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, and life support or weapons systems.  Emmanuel Deviller specifically disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such purposes.

6) Limitation on Liability

IN NO CASE SHALL Emmanuel Deviller BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COVER OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS OR THE INABILITY TO USE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED UPON A BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.  THIS IS TRUE EVEN IF Emmanuel Deviller IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ANY LIABILITY OF Emmanuel Deviller OR ANY OF ITS PARTNERS WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO A REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE BY THE USER TO Emmanuel Deviller.
